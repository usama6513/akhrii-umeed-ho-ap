## Prompt

/sp.constitution
# Constitution Amendment: Visual Identity & UI/UX
## 1. Design Philosophy: "The Cyber-Physical Look"
We are moving beyond a standard documentation site. The UI must feel like a **futuristic interface** for controlling robots.
* **Primary Vibe:** Modern, Clean, Dark-Mode First.
* **Color Palette:**
    * **Primary Color:** Electric Blue / Cyan (representing AI/Electricity) instead of default Green.
    * **Background:** Deep Slate/Black (for high contrast).
    * **Accents:** Neon Purple (for "AI Brain" concepts).
## 2. Component Requirements
### **A. The Landing Page (`src/pages/index.js`)**
* **Hero Section:** Must be bold and centered.
    * **Headline:** "Build the Body. Code the Brain."
    * **Sub-headline:** "The World's First Spec-Driven Course on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. **Written by Sharmeen Fatima**."
    * **Buttons:** Two big buttons: "Start Learning (Module 1)" and "View Syllabus".
* **Feature Cards:** Below the hero, display 3 cards:
    * "🤖 Embodied Intelligence"
    * "🧠 Spec-Driven Development"
    * "⚡ Sim-to-Real Transfer"
### **B. Global Styling (`src/css/custom.css`)**
* **Fonts:** Use a clean sans-serif font (Inter or Roboto) for readability.
* **Admonitions:** Custom style for `:::tip`, `:::warning`, etc., to look like "System Alerts" (e.g., rounded corners, slight glow).
* **Navbar:** Sticky, with a glass-morphism effect (blur background).
## 3. Configuration (`docusaurus.config.js`)
* **Navbar Items:**
    * Left: Logo + "Physical AI Textbook"
    * Right: "Modules" (Dropdown), "**GitHub**" (linking to https://github.com/Sharmeen-Fatima), "Panaversity"
* **Footer:** Clean footer with copyright and social links. **Include: "© 2025 Sharmeen Fatima. All rights reserved." followed by links to GitHub and LinkTree. Style the links as icons if possible (e.g., GitHub icon for the GitHub link).**
**Action Required:**
1. Adopt these UI rules.
2. **IMMEDIATELY** update `docusaurus.config.js` to change the `primaryColor` config.
3. **IMMEDIATELY** rewrite `src/css/custom.css` with these new colors and styles.
4. **IMMEDIATELY** rewrite `src/pages/index.js` to create the new Hero section.
