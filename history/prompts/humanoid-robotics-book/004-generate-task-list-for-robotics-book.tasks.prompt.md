## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Extract tech stack, libraries, project structure from plan.md
   - Extract user stories with priorities (P1, P2, P3) from spec.md
   - Generate tasks organized by user story
   - Generate dependency graph
   - Create parallel execution examples
   - Validate task completeness

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use template, fill with:
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (priority order)
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting
   - Dependencies section
   - Parallel execution examples
   - MVP scope

5. **Report**: Output path, total tasks, task count per story, parallel opportunities

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive task breakdown for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with 82 tasks organized by 5 user stories.

**Tasks Overview** (specs/physical-ai-textbook/tasks.md):

**Total Tasks**: 82
**Task Distribution**:
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 10 tasks - Project infrastructure and directory creation
- **Phase 2 (Foundation)**: 6 tasks - Sidebar configuration and navigation structure
- **Phase 3 (US1 - P1)**: 6 tasks - Module 1 content (Beginner Learning Path)
- **Phase 4 (US2 - P1)**: 18 tasks - Modules 2-5 content with diagrams (Visual Learner)
- **Phase 5 (US3 - P2)**: 10 tasks - Code quality and practitioner enhancements
- **Phase 6 (US4 - P2)**: 6 tasks - Sim-to-real transfer techniques
- **Phase 7 (US5 - P3)**: 6 tasks - VLA pipeline integration
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 20 tasks - Assets, meta content, build verification

**Parallelizable Tasks**: 68 out of 82 tasks marked with [P] for concurrent execution

**User Story Organization**:

1. **US1 - Complete Beginner Learning Path (P1)**: 6 tasks
   - Independent Test: Beginner completes Module 1 in 3 hours, writes first ROS 2 node
   - Deliverable: intro.md + 5 Module 1 chapters, 6 diagrams, 7 code examples
   - Tasks: T017-T022 (all parallelizable)

2. **US2 - Visual Learner Experience (P1)**: 18 tasks
   - Independent Test: Every concept has Mermaid diagram understandable independently
   - Deliverable: 18 chapters (Modules 2-5), 24+ diagrams, 13+ code examples
   - Tasks: T023-T040 (all parallelizable)

3. **US3 - Hands-On Practitioner Path (P2)**: 10 tasks
   - Independent Test: All code runs without modification in ROS 2 Humble
   - Deliverable: Type hints, error handling, 20 hands-on exercises
   - Tasks: T041-T050 (all parallelizable)

4. **US4 - Concept-to-Real Transfer (P2)**: 6 tasks
   - Independent Test: Sim-to-real techniques validated with before/after
   - Deliverable: Transfer checklist, domain randomization, alternative paths
   - Tasks: T051-T056 (all parallelizable)

5. **US5 - Natural Language Robot Control (P3)**: 6 tasks
   - Independent Test: VLA pipeline executes voice commands
   - Deliverable: Multi-step commands, prompt templates, dependencies
   - Tasks: T057-T062 (all parallelizable)

**MVP Scope Defined**:
- **Recommended MVP**: Phases 1-3 (22 tasks)
- **MVP Deliverable**: Working site + Module 1 + beginner can write first node
- **Post-MVP Increments**: 6 incremental phases for iterative delivery

**Key Features**:

1. **Strict Format Compliance**:
   - All tasks follow: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
   - Example: `- [ ] T017 [P] [US1] Write docs/intro.md (textbook preface...)`
   - 100% format validation passed

2. **Dependency Graph**:
   - Mermaid diagram showing user story completion order
   - Setup → Foundation → US1/US2 → US3/US4/US5 → Polish
   - Clear blocking relationships identified

3. **Parallel Execution Examples**:
   - Phase 3: All 6 Module 1 files can be written in parallel
   - Phase 4: All 18 Module 2-5 files can be written in parallel
   - Phase 5-7: All review/enhancement tasks parallelizable
   - Phase 8: Assets, meta, validation can run concurrently

4. **Independent Test Criteria**:
   - Each user story has clear verification method
   - Tests focus on learner outcomes (not code tests - not requested in spec)
   - Acceptance scenarios map to specific deliverables

5. **File Path Specificity**:
   - Every content task includes exact file path
   - Example: `docs/module-01-ros2/02-first-node.md`
   - No ambiguity in task descriptions

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase delivers complete, testable value
- **MVP First**: 22 tasks deliver working Module 1 for beginners
- **Parallel Work**: 68 tasks can be executed concurrently
- **Independent Stories**: Each user story can be verified alone

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown enabling incremental, parallelized implementation
- 🧪 Tests: Manual build verification (T071-T077), link validation (T078-T080)
- 📁 Files: 1 tasks.md created with 82 actionable tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin Phase 1 (Setup), then implement MVP (Phases 1-3)
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks successfully organized by user story priority, enabling MVP-first delivery with clear parallel opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation - PASS (all tasks follow checklist format)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): tasks-001-physical-ai-textbook
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute Phase 1 (Setup) tasks T001-T010 to prepare infrastructure
