# API Contracts

This directory is reserved for API contracts, such as OpenAPI (Swagger) or GraphQL schema definitions.

For the "AI-Driven Humanoid Robotics Development Book" project, there are no external-facing REST or GraphQL APIs being developed. The project's focus is on creating a static documentation site with Docusaurus and providing Python/C++ code examples for robotics applications.

Therefore, this directory is not applicable and remains empty.
